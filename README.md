# Warning: List of Untrustworthy Telegram Promoters, telegram SOL, ETH, BSC CALLERS

## Introduction

This document serves as a cautionary list of Telegram promoters, often referred to as "callers," who have been identified as untrustworthy or deceptive in their practices. Engaging with these individuals or entities for promotional purposes is strongly discouraged.

## Important Notice

**DO NOT** engage with or purchase coins calls/promotions from the entities listed here.

For evidence and further details, please refer to my Telegram channel: [TGCallers](https://t.me/tgcallers).

## Recommendation

It is advised to unfollow and disengage with any of the mentioned entities if you are currently following them. I operate a bot that monitors over 500+ callers. Any instances of dubious activities, such as promoting questionable projects ("rugs"), will be highlighted and shared on [@tgcallers](https://t.me/tgcallers).

## Context

While acknowledging the pervasive nature of these practices within the industry, it's important to recognize that some promoters may indeed generate substantial revenue by marketing pre-sales, among other activities. These individuals often manipulate their track records by falsifying entry points or omitting unsuccessful calls.

## Upcoming Updates

I am committed to identifying and sharing information about reputable callers in the near future. This initiative aims to foster a more transparent and reliable promotional ecosystem within the Telegram community.

## Caution Against "Call Analyzer" Channels

Please exercise caution and skepticism towards "call analyzer" channels. These platforms tend to indiscriminately aggregate information from various sources, contributing to misinformation and overall confusion. **NFA (Not Financial Advice) | DYOR (Do Your Own Research).**
